    "There are usually many ways to represent any given abstract data structures. In Python, however, these ways will always be based on classes and objects, something that goes beyond this class. Therefore, I will just give you a few examples and hope you can figure out from those how trees can be traversed, at least.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way classes work is that we define a class with syntax similar to functions, but nested functions work as so-called methods and must always take an object as their first argument. Traditionally this object is called `self`. The way methods work is very similar to functions, except that the syntax for calling a method is slightly different. To call a function, `f`, on an object `x`, we write `f(x)`, while for a method we write `x.f()`. The reason we have both methods and functions is that methods can be \"polymorphic\", meaning that the actual function that is called when we write `x.f()` depends on the type of `x`. This goes beyond the scope of this class, however, so you should for now just think of methods as functions with a slightly different syntax.\n",

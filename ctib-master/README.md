# Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics

Lecture notes and material for the class *Computational Thinking in Bioinformatics* at the *Bioinformatics Research Centre, Aarhus University*.

 
## Week 1: Computational thinking

### Lecture:
* Problem domain / models / goals and problems / solutions / implementations

### Exercises:
* Introduction to Python programming and Jupyter notebooks. 
* Branching and looping (JVG 2 + 3)

Besides the lectures and exercises, we could recommend a basic online course in Python programming that could be followed and maybe have some of the exercises in relation to this.


## Week 2:  Algorithm analysis

### Lectures:
* Correctness and complexity
* Pre- and post-conditions and invariants -- exemplified by e.g. different sorting algorithms
* O-notation and reasoning about complexity
 
### Exercises:
* Functions (JVG 4)
* Basic data structures (JVG 5)
 
## Week 3: Implementing algorithms

### Lectures:
* Translating ideas into code by breaking them down to the right level of abstraction
* Running time in practise
 
### Exercises:
* Testing and debugging (JVG 6)
* Plotting (JVG 11.1)
* Complexity (JVG 9)
 
## Week 4: Algorithmic design

### Lectures:
* Pre- and post-conditions and invariants revisited
* Recursion
* Divide and conquer 
* Dynamic programming
 
### Exercises:
* Dynamic programming examples (JVG 13)
 
## Week 5: Data structures and trees

### Lectures:
* Representing trees as lists
* Traversing trees, e.g. DFS for outputting a tree

### Exercises: 
* Implementing a tree representation
* Potentially a Newick parser
* DFS traversal and outputting a tree
 
 
## Week 6: Data structures and graphs

### Lectures:
* Representing graphs as incidence lists or matrices
 
### Exercises:
* Classical graph algorithms (JVG 12.2)

 
## Week 7: Complexity of problems

### Lectures:
* Problem complexity versus solution (algorithm) complexity
* NP-hardness
 
### Exercises:
???

## Week 11: Guided project; building a bioinformatics tool; training (optimization)

### Lectures:
* Training by counting (maximum likelihood estimation for an HMM)
 
### Exercises:
Training by counting
 
## Week 12: Guided project; experimental validation

### Lectures:
* How to statistically validate correctness
* How to (statistically) validate running time
